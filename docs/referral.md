# Deep Learning Referal Assignment: SE-ResNet

## Overview

[Squeeze and Excitation Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf) proposed a simple addition to a residual connection which was shown to give state of the art performance. In this assignment you will explore if you can get a performance boost on the CIFAR-10 classification problem by using SE-blocks in your model.

## Details

The task is to compare two different network architectures on the CIFAR-10 classification problem:

- A simple ResNet-18 network
- The same ResNet-18, but with Squeeze and Excitation blocks added to the skip connections

You are free to determine your own training regime (optimisers, augmentation, etc.), however you should be fair in your experiments, and try not to bias the results towards one or other of the models by over-optimising the hyperparameters. You need to write a report that describes your experimental methodology and your results (e.g. classification accuracy and perhaps class confusion matrices, etc.). You should also reflect on what these results mean, and any limitations of your experiments.

### Deliverables

* **Report and accompanying code for experiments.** You must submit a report in the style of a conference paper. The paper must use the [ICLR 2019 style](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/archive/ICLR2019.tar.gz), and be at most 4 pages in length, including all references and appendices (if used). 

### Mark Scheme

The report and accompanying code will be marked as a single piece of work using the following criteria:


Criterion                    | Description                                                                                | Marks
-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------
Experimentation and Analysis | Development of an experimental methodology, and use of this methodology to generate results| 45
Reflection			         | Reflect on what your experimental results tell us                                          | 45
Reporting                    | Clear and professional reporting                                                           | 10
