## Remaining lectures

The following topics will be covered as full 45-minute video lectures, and made available from the [course web page](comp6248.ecs.soton.ac.uk):

- Embeddings
- Auto-encoders, unsupervised learning and self-supervision
- Differentiable relaxations and reparameterisations
- Generative Models

The remaining lecture slots were originally planned to be a mixture of guest lectures from PhD students, as well as some assorted topics (transformers and BERT, Emergence of Language, NAS, ...). The guest lectures will be cancelled (although I hope to get a recording of one from another event to make available). The remaining content will be covered in a series of shorter video lectures.

All the videos have (or will be) uploaded via panopto. Direct links to the videos have been consolidated on the course web page (and on blackboard/coursecast). After each lecture I'll host an online Q&A session, using Blackboard Collaborate, Teams and the existing Slack channel.

## Remaining labs

There are still three lab sessions outstanding. These will run virtually (using either Google colab, ECS's remote GPU service or the student's own machine) at the normal scheduled time. The PhD demonstrator team will be asked to be live on the Slack and Teams channels to answer questions and talk to any students that need help. The lab timetable has been updated to restart from the 29th April for three weeks.

The assessed lab exercises will be made available for the start of each lab as is currently being done. The deadline for handin has been moved to the 20th May. 

## Online quiz 2

This should run in pretty much the same way the first one did (using blackboard) - rescheduled to the 14th May.

## Group Coursework

This will continue as before - it's worth 40% or the overall mark and carried out over the entire duration of the module. Students can ask the lab demonstrators for help during the scheduled lab sessions. We can also schedule another time for the demonstrators to be available for Q&A if there is demand. The deadline will be extended to the 
29th May. 

## Behind the scenes

It's fair to say that all your lecturers are working hard to ensure that you're able to finish your modules and courses. We've had to improvise "lecture theatres" in our houses and learn some new skills in video production as you can see from my short behind-the-scenes video.
